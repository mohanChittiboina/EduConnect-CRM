# EduConnect CRM – Student, Faculty & Alumni Relationship Management

---

## 📌 Phase 1: Problem Understanding & Industry Analysis  

### Requirement Gathering  
Educational institutions face challenges in managing students, faculty, courses, and alumni relationships. Traditional methods like spreadsheets or fragmented ERPs are inefficient. Institutions need:  
- Centralized student records (admissions, performance, attendance).  
- Faculty workload and course allocation management.  
- Alumni tracking and engagement.  
- Automated communications (admission confirmation, reminders, alumni events).  
- Reports and dashboards for academic performance and resource utilization.  

### Stakeholder Analysis  
- **Students** → Need smooth admission, enrollment, and communication.  
- **Faculty** → Require workload balance, course assignments, and student data access.  
- **Administrators** → Manage admissions, monitor student performance, and oversee operations.  
- **Alumni** → Stay connected with institution for networking & events.  
- **Management/Executives** → View analytics and reports for decision-making.  

### Business Process Mapping  
- **Admission** → Students apply, system verifies, sends confirmation.  
- **Enrollment** → Students assigned courses and advisors.  
- **Faculty Allocation** → Admin assigns courses to faculty.  
- **Tracking** → Attendance, grades, and performance monitored.  
- **Alumni Engagement** → System tracks alumni details & event participation.  

### Industry-Specific Use Case Analysis  
- **Universities** → Large-scale admission + multiple faculties.  
- **Colleges** → Streamlined faculty-course allocation & student monitoring.  
- **Schools** → Parent communication, attendance, student progress.  
- **Coaching Centers** → Enrollment tracking, fee reminders, and performance metrics.  

### AppExchange Exploration  
- Salesforce Education Cloud (robust but expensive for small institutions).  
- Blackbaud Education Management → Strong LMS features but limited Salesforce-native integration.  
- **Gap Identified** → Affordable Salesforce-native CRM tailored for admissions, faculty management, and alumni relations.
